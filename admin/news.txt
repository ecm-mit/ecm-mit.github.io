Zach Receives Award from the Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Startup Program
August 16, 2018
Dr. Zach Hood has received an award under the Pakistan-U.S. Science & Technology Start-up Program sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and RTI Innovation Advisors, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of State, USAID, and the Pakistan Higher Education Commission (HEC). 
The startup project "Empowering Pakistani Women through Translational Research in the Sciences: Waste-to-Energy Conversion and Water Purification Technology Development" will be carried out as a collaboration between the ECM at MIT (Zach Hood), Wake Forest University (Abdou Lachgar), and the University of Sindh in Jamshoro, Pakistan (Najma Memon).
The overall goal of the project ist tocommercialize materials for waste-to-energy conversion and water purification, thereby empowering Pakistani women in the science and technology sector. 
The training program portion of the award will take place in Dubai, where the team will learn how to commercialize the technologies and create a start-up in Pakistan.
Congrats Zach!
