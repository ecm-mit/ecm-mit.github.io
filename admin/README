How to write news articles:

Add to the top of the file with the format:

TITLE
DATE
BODY1
BODY2
...
IMAGE: path_to_image1
IMAGE: path_to_image2
...

Links can be added into any body using standard HTML (<a href=...>blahblah</a). The image lines are optional. Image paths should be relative to news/index.html. Be sure to separate news stories by a single empty line! 

To update the site's pages with the new info, run the update_news.py script (requires Python 3). This will update the home page as well as the news page.
